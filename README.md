[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ryanfb/iiif-universe.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.com/ryanfb/iiif-universe)

A Universe is a directory of catalogs published by service providers which lists their available assets. This Universe is intended to present a [collection](http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.0/#collections) which points to other collections as [machine-actionable JSON](http://ryanfb.github.io/iiif-universe/iiif-universe.json).

In `catalogs`, community-maintained IIIF collections are available for sites which don't appear to have a top-level IIIF collection.

Pull requests are welcome.
